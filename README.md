# my python course.

I am trying to teach my daughters how to program in python (summer vacation time, so it's time to teach something!) 
Now I am trying to prepare my notes on the subject, this is another opportunity to make things clearer to me, first of all.

We are trying to use visual studio code with the microsoft python plugin.
