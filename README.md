# My python course.

I am trying to teach my daughters how to program in python (summer vacation time, so it's time to teach something!) 
Now I am trying to prepare my notes on the subject, this is another opportunity to make things clearer to me, first of all.

My plan is to teach some basics, then doing stuff with the [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) library, and then to do some games with the [pygames](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) library (no i have to learn these libraries, to begin with...)

## Environment 

We are trying to use visual studio code with the microsoft python plugin.

1. To set it up: first download python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download visual studio code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
3. In visual studio code: press 'Extensions' button on the vertical bar (lowest icon), search for Python and install the first one in the list
4. Set autosave:
    1. in File menu: select Auto Save option, so that a checkmark appears
    2. in Code menu, select Preferences, then select settings, search for auto save, for Auto Save select afterDelay for Auto Save Delay select 1
