# My python course.

I am trying to teach my daughters how to program in python (summer vacation time, so it's time to teach something!) 
Now I am trying to prepare my notes on the subject, this is another opportunity to make things clearer to me, first of all.

We are trying to use visual studio code with the microsoft python plugin.

My plan is to teach some basics, then doing stuff with the [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) library, and then to do some games with the [pygames](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) library (no i have to learn these libraries, to begin with...)
